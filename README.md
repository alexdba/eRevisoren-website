eRevisoren.dk
=============

This is the main repository for the eRevisoren.dk website (http://eRevisoren.dk).
This application is built using the Yii 2 framework, and based on the [Yii 2 Practical
Application Template](https://github.com/kartik-v/yii2-app-practical).

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application. It is designed to work in a team development environment. 
It supports deploying the application in different environments.

KEY SETTINGS
------------

1. The template has some security preconfigured for users with Apache web servers. It has a default `.htaccess` security configuration setup.
2. The template has prettyUrl enabled by default and the changes have been made to `.htaccess` as well as `urlManager`
   component config in the common config directory.
3. The template has isolated cookie settings for backend and frontend so that you can seamlessly access frontend and backend from same client. 
   The config files includes special `identity` and `csrf` cookie parameter settings for backend.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this application template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from Git

Fork [this repo](https://github.com/OO-developers/website), and clone the application using Git.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Run command `init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
2. Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
3. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`. This will create tables needed for the application to work.
4. Set document roots of your Web server:

- for frontend `/path/to/yii-application/` and using the URL `http://frontend/`
- for backend `/path/to/yii-application/backend/web/` and using the URL `http://backend/`

To login into the application, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password.
Then, you can login into the application with same email address and password at any time.

5. Edit the config files as needed. Especially set the correct paths for the user identity cookie in `backend/config/main-local.php`.
